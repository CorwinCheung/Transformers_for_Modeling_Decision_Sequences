# Transformers_for_Modeling_Decision_Sequences
I will use language sequencing models to capture the decisions mice make in a dynamic, probabilistic task. This will involve modeling experimental data from real mouse decisions and synthetic data generated via descriptive models, which have been shown to capture general behavioral features in bandit tasks.
